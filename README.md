# Mercury Development Frontend Test Assignment

- Use the prepared project structure. 
- Build a web app based on the [mockups](https://www.figma.com/file/L0NUuF0qAjNAkhGc0upBDB/Frontend_Internship?node-id=2%3A604&t=yR560xVot0xEHgQ4-1) from Figma. 
    - The layout is mobile only.
    - It should be 100% of the window width but no wider than 600px.
- Use `api/index.js` to mock the API calls. Also, as a part of this assignment rewrite it on TypeScript. Keep in mind that API service can be extended and all API endpoints will have similar response structure.
